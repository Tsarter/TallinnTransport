## Json merger

A day has up to 2880 files about realtime data. To make it easier to handle, there is this helper function that merges those files into one. 2880 files -> 1 file. I have found that the end file is too big for the browser (~200mb). So that only couple of hours can be merged together. Some other solution is needed.

## Visualizer
